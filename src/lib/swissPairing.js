/**
 * Swiss Pairing Algorithm for Chess Tournaments
 * 
 * This implementation follows the basic Swiss system rules:
 * 1. Players with the same score are paired together when possible
 * 2. No player should play against the same opponent twice
 * 3. Each player should have an equal number of white and black games when possible
 * 4. Players are paired based on their current score
 */

/**
 * Generate pairings for a tournament round using the Swiss system
 * @param {Array} players - Array of player objects with scores and previous opponents
 * @param {Number} round - Current round number
 * @returns {Array} - Array of match objects with white and black player assignments
